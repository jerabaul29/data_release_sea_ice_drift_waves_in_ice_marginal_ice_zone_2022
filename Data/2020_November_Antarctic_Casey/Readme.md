The deployment around Casey, Antarctica, by J. Voermans et. al. Instrumetns v2018 were used. These were recovered at the end of the deployment, which allowed to collect the full content of the SD cards containing time series of the wave signal. The "Data" folder contains the SD raw data, i.e. recordings of the wave signals at 10Hz. The "Instruments_V_2018" folder contains the standard analysis of the transmitted iridium messages.

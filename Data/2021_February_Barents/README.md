These data were obtained in the context of the Nansen Legacy Cruise PC-2: Winter Process Cruise (WPC) that took place in 2021. The data are gathered by a combination of:

- 6 instruments v2018
- 12 instruments v2021a. These are early prototypes of the successors to the instruments v2018. Most of them were only equipped with GPS sensor and iridium and only reported position (8 instruments), while a few were equipped with an early prototype of the new version of the wave sensor (4 instruments), though there were technical challenges with this early version, and data are missing quite often.
- the UG probe and IMU, measuring from the boat, though this was the first time it was used during the middle of the winter, and icing on the UG probe was a problem.

- the ```data_analysis``` folder contains a variety of visualizations, analysis, etc.
